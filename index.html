            <h2>My Family</h2>
            <p>This upcoming fall, I will be continuing my studies at UBC at the Point-Grey campus. I was accepted into the
               Faculty of Science and will pick my major after first year. Currently, I am interested in pursuing a career 
               related to Computer Science and coding related work, but there is still a long time before I have to decide. 
               I am open to exploring different options including Pharmacology to Biochemistry or even a combined major with
               Computer Science and Biochemistry. I will be taking a variety of courses (10 to be exact) during my first year
               of university and I hope I will find something that captures my interest. If Computer Science does not work out 
               for me, I would like to go to Medical School or Dentistry to become a doctor/dentist. </p>
